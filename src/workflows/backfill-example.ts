/**
 * TEMPLATE — not registered by default. Copy this when a release adds a column
 * that needs populating on existing rows.
 *
 * Follow the expand → migrate → contract sequence:
 *   1. Release N: migration adds the column (nullable / defaulted); code writes
 *      both old and new. Deploy.
 *   2. Run THIS job once (Hatchet dashboard, or `hatchet.events.push`) to
 *      backfill existing rows. It's batched, idempotent and resumable.
 *   3. Release N+1: code reads the new column. Release N+2: migration drops the
 *      old column / adds NOT NULL once the backfill is confirmed complete.
 *
 * To enable: add `backfillExampleTask` to the `extraWorkflows` array in
 * `src/workflows/index.ts` (already wired by default), which is passed to
 * `createWorker({ container, journeys, extraWorkflows })` in src/worker.ts. The
 * example below assumes a `contacts.normalized_email` column was just added —
 * change the table/columns to match your migration.
