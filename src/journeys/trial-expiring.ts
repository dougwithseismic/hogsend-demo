/**
 * Example lifecycle journey — a trial-expiring reminder. Enroll a user when
 * their trial starts; the journey durably waits
 * out the trial, then emails them a few days before it ends — unless they've
 * already converted, in which case `exitOn` pulls them out cleanly.
 *
 * This pairs with the `lifecycle/trial-expiring` email template. Emit
 * `trial.started` from your billing/signup code (e.g.
 * `hs.events.send({ name: "trial.started", userId, contactProperties: {...} })`),
 * and `subscription.started` when they pay.
 *
 * Copy this file to add your own journeys, then register them in
 * `src/journeys/index.ts`.
