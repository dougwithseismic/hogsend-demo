# Hogsend demo — Forgeline

The public demo instance of [Hogsend](https://hogsend.com) — marketing
automation for teams that code, on PostHog + Resend. This repo is a real
`create-hogsend` app running the published `@hogsend/engine` (`0.40.0`),
deployed at:

**[demo.hogsend.com](https://demo.hogsend.com)** — one-click Studio access with
the shared login shown on the landing page (`demo@hogsend.com` /
`forgeline-demo-2026`).

The narrative is **Forgeline**, a fictional credit-based AI code-review + CI
product. Contacts sign up, connect repos, run builds, buy and spend credits —
and the journeys in `src/journeys/` respond:

- `activation-connect-repo` / `activation-first-review` — signup → repo
  connected → first green build
- `credits-topup-nudge` / `credits-dunning` — 80%-of-credits nudge, zero-balance
  dunning
- `expansion-seats` — usage milestone → add seats
- `feedback-nps` — NPS survey with a reminder branch
- `winback-repo-quiet` — repo goes quiet → winback offer

Journeys fan out across all four Hogsend channels — email, in-app feed/bell,
Discord, Telegram (`src/journeys/channels.ts`) — with 16 React Email templates
in `src/emails/`. The Studio data (3,214 contacts, ~46k email sends with
open/click/bounce funnels) comes from a deterministic seed with fully relative
timestamps, so it always reads as the last six months. No real email provider
is configured; the demo can't send mail to anyone.

Everything below is the standard scaffold README — clone this repo and run the
same app locally, or scaffold your own with `pnpm create hogsend@latest`.

---

The engine is a versioned dependency; **your content**
(journeys, email templates, webhook sources, workflows, schema) lives in `src/`
and is yours to edit.

## Prerequisites

- Node 22 (`.node-version`)
- pnpm (or npm / yarn / bun)
- Docker (for local Timescale + Redis + Hatchet-Lite)

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm bootstrap     # first run only: Docker + .env + Hatchet token + migrate
pnpm hogsend dev   # the daily driver: API + worker + health + URLs, one terminal
```

`hogsend dev` runs the whole local stack from one command — it reuses the infra
and credentials bootstrap set up, runs migrations, spawns the API and worker as
prefixed child processes, waits for health, and prints the local URLs (API,
Studio, Hatchet dashboard). Ctrl+C stops everything. Fire a test event from a
second terminal with `pnpm hogsend dev --fire test.signup --email you@example.com`.

Prefer the processes by hand? `pnpm dev` (HTTP API on `http://localhost:3002`)
plus `pnpm worker:dev` (Hatchet worker) in two terminals is the manual
equivalent.

`pnpm bootstrap` is idempotent — re-run it any time. It creates `.env` (with a
fresh `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`), brings up Timescale + Redis + Hatchet-Lite
(auto-remapping any host ports already in use, so multiple stacks coexist),
mints a Hatchet token for you, and runs both migration tracks.

Using npm / yarn / bun? Swap `pnpm` for `npm run` / `yarn` / `bun run`
(e.g. `npm run bootstrap`).

API docs: `http://localhost:3002/docs`. Health: `GET /v1/health`. Full docs:
[docs.hogsend.com](https://docs.hogsend.com).

## Sending domain & test mode

Set a real `RESEND_API_KEY` in `.env` to send email — and note that while your
sending domain is unverified, **test mode** redirects every send to your own
inbox (subject prefixed `[TEST → …]`), so nothing reaches a real recipient
prematurely. If you scaffolded with `--domain`, `EMAIL_FROM` + `EMAIL_DOMAIN`
are already set in `.env`; otherwise uncomment them in the "Sending domain"
block.

Verify the domain from the CLI (admin key required), with the app running:

```bash
pnpm hogsend domain add yourdomain.com   # register + print DNS records for your DNS host
pnpm hogsend domain check                # poll until verified — test mode exits within 60s
pnpm hogsend domain status               # state, records, test-mode banner
```

`add` detects your DNS host via NS lookup and, on Cloudflare/Vercel, offers to
apply the records automatically when a `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` / `VERCEL_TOKEN`
is set. Details:
[docs.hogsend.com/docs/operating/test-mode](https://docs.hogsend.com/docs/operating/test-mode).

## PostHog

If you answered the scaffolder's PostHog prompt (or passed
`--posthog-key phc_… [--posthog-host https://eu.i.posthog.com]`), `.env`
already carries the wiring as **active** values:

- `POSTHOG_API_KEY` + `POSTHOG_HOST` — event capture + person property writes
- `ENABLE_POSTHOG_DESTINATION=true` — the email lifecycle fans out to PostHog
  durably, on the delivery spine
- `POSTHOG_WEBHOOK_SECRET` — freshly minted; verifies inbound PostHog
  webhooks at `POST /v1/webhooks/posthog`

Skipped it (or passed `--no-posthog`)? Nothing was touched — uncomment the
same lines in `.env` whenever you're ready.

Once the app is deployed, finish the loop with one command:

```bash
pnpm hogsend connect posthog   # wires person reads + the PostHog→Hogsend event loop
```

The `phc_` project key is write-only by PostHog's design, so `connect` sets up
the read credential (per-user timezone resolution, property conditions) and
points PostHog's event stream back at your instance — the people your journeys
email and the persons in PostHog stay one identity. Details:
[docs.hogsend.com/docs/guides/analytics-access](https://docs.hogsend.com/docs/guides/analytics-access).

## Verify the pipeline (end-to-end smoke)

With `pnpm dev` + `pnpm worker:dev` running (and an ingest-scoped
`HOGSEND_API_KEY` in `.env` — `pnpm bootstrap` mints one for you):

```bash
curl -XPOST http://localhost:3002/v1/events \
  -H "authorization: Bearer $HOGSEND_API_KEY" \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"test.signup","userId":"smoke-1","email":"smoke@example.com"}'
```

The bundled `test-onboarding` journey runs to completion (no email / external
deps). Watch it in the Hatchet dashboard, or query `journey_states`.
`GET /v1/health` should report `schema.engine.inSync:true` and
`schema.client.inSync:true`.

## Integrate from your app

The data plane is the typed front door to this engine — call it from your own
product code (a signup handler, a billing webhook, a cron) via the configured
`@hogsend/client` instance in `src/lib/hogsend.ts`. It needs an ingest-scoped
`HOGSEND_API_KEY` and `API_PUBLIC_URL` pointing at this API.

```ts
import { hs } from "./lib/hogsend.js";

// Upsert (create or merge) a contact — identity is email and/or userId.
await hs.contacts.upsert({
  userId: "user_123",
  email: "ada@example.com",
  properties: { plan: "pro" }, // -> contacts.properties
});

// Send an event — this is what enrolls a contact into a matching journey.
// `eventProperties` feed trigger.where / exitOn; `contactProperties` merge
// onto the contact (the D2 split — the two bags are never conflated).
await hs.events.send({
  userId: "user_123",
  name: "test.signup",
  eventProperties: { source: "pricing-page" },
  contactProperties: { signupCompleted: true },
});

// Manage list membership (defined in src/lists/index.ts).
await hs.lists.subscribe({ list: "product-updates", userId: "user_123" });
```

`hs.events.send` returns `{ stored, exits }`; `hs.contacts.upsert` returns
`{ id, created, linked }`. See `packages/client` (the `@hogsend/client` README)
for the full surface, and the `hogsend` CLI (`pnpm hogsend events send …`,
`pnpm hogsend contacts upsert …`) for the same operations from a shell.

## Examples included

A fresh app ships with a small, curated example set spanning the three ways to
send. Everything is **content**: edit, rename, or delete freely.

| Send mode | How it's sent | Templates |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Transactional** | one-off, `hs.emails.send` / `POST /v1/emails` | `transactional/magic-link`, `transactional/receipt` |
| **Lifecycle** | from a journey | `activation/welcome`, `activation/nudge`, `lifecycle/trial-expiring` |
| **Marketing** | broadcast to a list, `hs.campaigns.send` | `marketing/product-update` |

- **Journeys** (`src/journeys/`): `welcome` (a trimmed welcome series),
  `trial-expiring` (waits out a trial, then reminds — unless the user converts),
  and `test-onboarding` (the no-email smoke journey).
- **Lists** (`src/lists/index.ts`): `product-updates` — the marketing template's
  `category` matches this list id, so a broadcast only reaches subscribers.
- **Buckets** (`src/buckets/`): `power-users` — a real-time audience.

### Send a one-off transactional email

```ts
import { hs } from "./lib/hogsend.js";

await hs.emails.send({
  to: "ada@example.com",
  template: "transactional/magic-link",
  props: { loginUrl: "https://app.example.com/auth/magic?token=abc" },
});
```

### Broadcast a marketing campaign to a list

`hs.campaigns.send` durably sends one template to every **subscribed** member of
a list (the engine enqueues; the worker fans out the sends). The
`marketing/product-update` template's `category` is `product-updates`, so this
respects each contact's opt-in to that list.

```ts
import { hs } from "./lib/hogsend.js";

const { campaignId } = await hs.campaigns.send({
  name: "June product update",
  list: "product-updates", // defined in src/lists/index.ts
  template: "marketing/product-update",
  props: {
    headline: "What's new in June",
    highlights: ["Faster enrollment", "New webhook sources"],
  },
});

// Poll for delivery counts.
const campaign = await hs.campaigns.get(campaignId);
```

Contacts opt into a list with `hs.lists.subscribe({ list: "product-updates", userId })`.

## Dev loop

- `pnpm dev` — API with hot reload (tsx watch)
- `pnpm worker:dev` — worker with hot reload
- `pnpm test` — vitest
- `pnpm check-types` — tsc
- `pnpm build` — tsup bundle to `dist/` (`pnpm start` / `pnpm worker` run it)

## Adding a journey

1. Create `src/journeys/my-journey.ts` using `defineJourney` (copy
   `src/journeys/welcome.ts` as a starting point).
2. Add any new event/template names to `src/journeys/constants/index.ts`.
3. Register it in `src/journeys/index.ts` (`journeys` array).

The journey's `trigger.event` is what enrolls a user; the engine routes
ingested events to matching journeys automatically.

## Adding a bucket

Buckets are real-time, code-defined groups of users — the peer of a journey. A
user joins the moment their data satisfies the bucket's `criteria` and leaves
when it stops; each transition fires `bucket:entered:<id>` / `bucket:left:<id>`
through the same ingestion spine a journey trigger binds to.

1. Create `src/buckets/my-bucket.ts` using `defineBucket` (copy
   `src/buckets/power-users.ts` as a starting point).
2. Register it in `src/buckets/index.ts` (`buckets` array) and add its id to the
   `BucketId` union in `src/journeys/constants/index.ts` — that keeps the typed
   `bucketEntered`/`bucketLeft` alias helpers typo-safe.

That's it for a bucket that just exists in Studio. To make a journey react, bind
its `trigger.event` to `bucketEntered("my-bucket")` (and optionally
`exitOn: [{ event: bucketLeft("my-bucket") }]`). Buckets are observe-only in
Studio — there is no visual builder; they live in code, like journeys.

## Adding a webhook source

1. Create `src/webhook-sources/my-source.ts` using `defineWebhookSource`
   (copy `src/webhook-sources/posthog.ts`).
2. Register it in `src/webhook-sources/index.ts`.

It is served at `POST /v1/webhooks/:sourceId`; the `transform` result feeds the
same ingestion pipeline that drives journeys. `auth` is a discriminated union:
`type: "match"` (shared-secret equality; open when the secret is unset) or
`type: "signature"` (`svix` / `stripe` / `hmac-hex` — fails closed when the
secret is unset).

The engine also ships **built-in integration presets** — Clerk, Supabase,
Stripe, and Segment — served at `POST /v1/webhooks/{clerk,supabase,stripe,segment}`
with no code to write. Each mounts when its secret env var is set
(`CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`,
`SEGMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) and `ENABLED_WEBHOOK_PRESETS` allows it. Defining your
own source with the same id overrides the preset.

## Outbound webhooks

The engine emits a signed (Standard Webhooks / Svix-style HMAC-SHA256) event
stream — `contact.*`, `email.*`, `journey.completed`, `bucket.*` — to your
HTTPS endpoints. Manage subscriptions with the CLI or the admin API:

```bash
pnpm hogsend webhooks create --url https://your.app/hooks --all-events
pnpm hogsend webhooks list
```

The CLI wraps `POST /v1/admin/webhooks` (admin key required). The signing secret
is shown once on create + rotate. On the subscriber side, verify deliveries with
`verifyHogsendWebhook({ payload, headers, secret })` from `@hogsend/client`.

## Customizing emails

Your email templates live in `src/emails/` — they're **yours**, edit freely. The
engine ships no business templates; it owns only the rendering machinery and the
delivery provider.

1. Edit or add a React Email component in `src/emails/` (copy `welcome.tsx`).
2. Add its prop type in `src/emails/types.ts`.
3. Register it in `src/emails/registry.ts` (key → component + subject + category).
4. Declare the key + props in `src/emails/templates.d.ts` so
   `sendEmail({ template, props })` is type-checked.

The `templates` registry is passed to `createHogsendClient({ email: { templates } })` and
threaded into the engine's tracked mailer (rendering, preferences, link/open
tracking, and the `email_sends` pipeline all come along for free). The template
keys line up with the `Templates` constants journeys send with.

## Adding a custom Hatchet task

1. Create a task in `src/workflows/` (copy `backfill-example.ts`).
2. Add it to the `extraWorkflows` array in `src/workflows/index.ts`.

`src/worker.ts` passes `extraWorkflows` to `createWorker`, so your tasks register
on worker start alongside the engine's built-ins.

## Swapping the email provider

The default email provider is Resend (built from `RESEND_API_KEY` /
`RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET`). To use Postmark, SES, etc., implement the engine's
`EmailProvider` contract (`import type { EmailProvider } from "@hogsend/engine"`)
— `send(msg)` + webhook parse/verify — and pass it as
`createHogsendClient({ email: { provider } })`. Rendering, tracking, preferences, and the
`email_sends` pipeline are engine-owned and unaffected by the swap.

## Migrations — two tracks

Hogsend uses **two independent migration tracks**:

- **Engine track** — owned by `@hogsend/db`, ledger
  `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`. Applied first. You never author these; they
  arrive when you bump `@hogsend/*`.
- **Client track** — owned by this repo, ledger `drizzle.__client_migrations`,
  files in `./migrations`. Your own tables live in `src/schema/index.ts`.

```bash
pnpm db:generate    # generate a CLIENT migration from src/schema changes
pnpm db:migrate     # apply engine track, then client track (scripts/migrate.ts)
```

`scripts/migrate.ts` always runs engine-then-client. The Railway
`preDeployCommand` (`pnpm db:migrate`) does the same before each deploy.

> **`db:push` ledger gotcha:** `pnpm db:push` writes schema objects directly
> WITHOUT recording a row in the migration ledger. Convenient for fast local
> iteration, but it leaves the ledger *behind* the actual schema, so a later
> `db:migrate` (or the boot guard) thinks migrations are pending. For anything
> you intend to deploy, use `db:generate` + `db:migrate`, not `db:push`.

## Upgrading the engine

```bash
pnpm up "@hogsend/*"      # bump engine + plugins to the next pinned line
pnpm db:migrate           # apply any new engine migrations
# then confirm: GET /v1/health shows engine + client both inSync:true
```

The boot guard in `src/index.ts` refuses to start if the **engine** schema is
behind the build (a behind-engine DB is a fatal misconfiguration). The
**client** track does not gate boot — a pending client migration surfaces as
`status:"migration_pending"` on `/v1/health` for you to resolve.
