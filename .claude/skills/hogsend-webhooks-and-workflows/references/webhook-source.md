# Reference: webhook sources (`defineWebhookSource`)

A webhook source turns an inbound HTTP request into an `IngestEvent`. Each source
is served by the engine at **`POST /v1/webhooks/{sourceId}`** and its output is
fed straight into `ingestEvent()` — so a webhook can store an event, push it to
Hatchet (routing it to matching journey tasks), evaluate journey exit conditions,
and upsert the contact.

You write the source files; the engine owns the route. Edit only
`src/webhook-sources/`.

## The shape you implement

`defineWebhookSource` is imported from `@hogsend/engine`. The definition object:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `meta.id` | `string` | The `:sourceId` segment in the URL. Keep it URL-safe. |
| `meta.name` | `string` | Human label. |
| `meta.description?` | `string` | Optional. |
| `auth` | discriminated union on `type` | `"match"` or `"signature"` — see below. |
| `schema?` | `z.ZodSchema<T>` | Optional Zod validator; on success `payload` is typed `T`. |
| `transform(payload, ctx)` | `=> Promise<IngestEvent \| null>` | Map payload → event. Return `null` to accept-and-skip. |

### Auth: a discriminated union on `type`

`auth` is a discriminated union — pick the variant that matches your provider:

```ts
// "match" — plain shared-secret equality (the PostHog scaffold source uses this)
auth: { type: "match"; header: string; envKey: string }

// "signature" — provider HMAC verification over the EXACT raw body bytes
auth: {
  type: "signature";
  scheme: "svix" | "stripe" | "hmac-hex";
  envKey: string;
  header?: string;             // the signature header to read
  fallbackMatchHeader?: string; // e.g. Supabase's plain x-supabase-webhook-secret
  verify?(args): boolean | Promise<boolean>; // optional override of the scheme
}
```

**Auth behaviour (important — the two variants differ on the unset-secret case):**

- **`"match"`** enforces auth **only when the env secret is set**. If
  `process.env[envKey]` is empty/undefined the source is treated as **open** (no
  auth). When the secret is present, the request must send it in `header` or as
  `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`, else the route returns `401`. Always set the
  secret in any non-local environment.
- **`"signature"`** **FAILS CLOSED** — when its secret is unset the route returns
  `401` and never reaches `transform`. The route reads the EXACT raw body once
  and verifies the HMAC (Svix / Stripe `t=…,v1=…` with 5-min tolerance / generic
  hex HMAC) over those bytes. The raw bytes are also exposed as `ctx.rawBody`.

### Validation

If you provide `schema`, the route runs `schema.safeParse(payload)` before
calling `transform`; a parse failure returns `400` and `transform` never runs.
Inside `transform`, `payload` is the parsed, typed value.

## The `transform` → `IngestEvent` contract

`transform(payload, ctx)` returns an `IngestEvent` (or `null`):

```ts
interface IngestEvent {
  event: string;                       // event name (this is what journeys trigger on)
  userId: string;                      // external/distinct id of the person
  userEmail: string;                   // "" if unknown — emptystring, not undefined
  properties: Record<string, unknown>; // event + person props; merged into the event
  idempotencyKey?: string;             // optional dedupe key (see below)
}
```

`ctx` is `{ db, logger, rawBody?, headers? }` — a Drizzle `Database`, the engine
logger, and (populated by the route) the EXACT raw request body bytes and the
lowercased request headers, for lookups/diagnostics or provider-specific raw
access inside the transform. It does **not** carry `hatchet` or the registry;
those are applied by the route when it calls `ingestEvent`.

Notes that match the engine's behaviour:

- `event` is the routing key. Hatchet routes the pushed event to every journey
  whose trigger declares `onEvents: [thatEvent]`. The decision to *enroll* (or
  *exit*) is then made by trigger/exit conditions — see the **hogsend-conditions**
  skill.
- `userEmail` should be `""` when unknown (the ingestion pipeline treats a falsy
  email as "no email" for the contact upsert). Don't pass `undefined`.
- Only JSON-scalar properties (`string | number | boolean | null`) survive the
  push to Hatchet; nested objects/arrays are dropped from the event payload that
  reaches journey tasks (they're still stored on the `userEvents` row). Flatten
  anything a journey needs to branch on into a scalar property.
- `idempotencyKey` (optional): when set, a duplicate delivery with the same key is
  a no-op (`{ stored: false }`) — use the provider's event id when available.
- Return `null` to accept the delivery (HTTP `200 { ok: true, skipped: true }`)
  without ingesting — e.g. event types you don't care about.

## Example: a source from the scaffold

`src/webhook-sources/posthog.ts` — validates a PostHog destination payload and
maps it to an `IngestEvent`:

```ts
import { defineWebhookSource } from "@hogsend/engine";
import { z } from "zod";

const posthogWebhookSchema = z.object({
  event: z.object({
    uuid: z.string().optional(),
    event: z.string(),
    distinct_id: z.string(),
    properties: z.record(z.string(), z.unknown()).optional(),
  }),
  person: z
    .object({
      properties: z
        .object({ email: z.string().optional() })
        .catchall(z.unknown())
        .optional(),
    })
    .optional(),
});

export const posthogSource = defineWebhookSource({
  meta: {
    id: "posthog",
    name: "PostHog",
    description: "Receives events from PostHog webhook destinations.",
  },
  auth: {
    header: "x-posthog-webhook-secret",
    envKey: "POSTHOG_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
    type: "match",
  },
  schema: posthogWebhookSchema,
  async transform(payload) {
    const rawEmail = payload.person?.properties?.email;
    const userEmail = typeof rawEmail === "string" ? rawEmail : "";

    const properties: Record<string, unknown> = {
      ...payload.event.properties,
      ...payload.person?.properties,
    };
    if (payload.event.uuid) {
      properties._posthogEventId = payload.event.uuid;
    }

    return {
      event: payload.event.event,
      userId: payload.event.distinct_id,
      userEmail,
      properties,
    };
  },
});
```

## Wiring it up (two edits)

### 1. Register in `src/webhook-sources/index.ts`

```ts
import type { DefinedWebhookSource } from "@hogsend/engine";
import { posthogSource } from "./posthog.js";
import { stripeSource } from "./stripe.js"; // your new source

export const webhookSources: DefinedWebhookSource[] = [
  posthogSource,
  stripeSource,
];
```

### 2. Pass to `createApp` in `src/index.ts`

The scaffold already threads this — confirm it's present:

```ts
import { webhookSources } from "./webhook-sources/index.js";

const app = createApp(client, { webhookSources });
```

That's it. Your source is now live at `POST /v1/webhooks/stripe`.

## Built-in integration presets (no code)

Before writing a source, check whether the engine already ships one. Four
presets are built into `@hogsend/engine` and served with no consumer code:

| Preset | Route | Scheme | Secret env var |
|--------|-------|--------|----------------|
| `clerk` | `POST /v1/webhooks/clerk` | `svix` | `CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `supabase` | `POST /v1/webhooks/supabase` | `svix` (+ plain `x-supabase-webhook-secret` fallback) | `SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `stripe` | `POST /v1/webhooks/stripe` | `stripe` | `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| `segment` | `POST /v1/webhooks/segment` | `hmac-hex` | `SEGMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` |

A preset mounts only when **both** its secret env var is set **and**
`ENABLED_WEBHOOK_PRESETS` allows it: `"*"`/absent = auto (every preset whose
secret is set), a comma-separated list of ids = exactly those (still requires the
secret), `"none"` = all off. A preset with no secret is never mounted (signature
sources fail closed). Defining your own `defineWebhookSource` with the SAME id
**overrides** the preset — the consumer always wins. Each preset's exact
provider-event → Hogsend-event mapping (and the `contactProperties` vs
`eventProperties` split) lives in its source file under
`packages/engine/src/webhook-sources/presets/`.

## Authoring a new source — checklist

1. Create `src/webhook-sources/<id>.ts` exporting a `defineWebhookSource({...})`.
2. Pick a unique `meta.id` (becomes the URL segment).
3. Set `auth.envKey` and add that secret to your env for non-local deploys.
4. Add a Zod `schema` for the payload you expect (recommended).
5. In `transform`, produce `{ event, userId, userEmail, properties }` (or `null`).
   Flatten anything a journey will branch on into a scalar property.
6. Add the export to the `webhookSources` array in `index.ts`.
7. Verify deliveries land using the **hogsend-cli** skill (events/contacts).
