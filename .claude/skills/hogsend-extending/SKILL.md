description: Use when extending a Hogsend app beyond journeys/emails/buckets — swapping the email or analytics provider behind its engine-owned contract (EmailProvider / PostHogService), wiring an outbound integration (Slack, a CRM, Stripe) as plain code called from a journey, fanning the outbound EVENT stream out to a tool via a code-defined destination (defineDestination, see hogsend-authoring-destinations), or deciding when to publish a reusable @hogsend/plugin-* package. Covers the categories of extension and where each is wired.

# Extending Hogsend

There are **three** ways to extend a Hogsend app, and they are different
mechanisms — don't reach for the wrong one.

1. **Capability providers** (email, analytics). The engine itself drives these,
   so each has an **engine-owned contract** you implement and swap behind.
   `EmailProvider` and `PostHogService` are defined in `@hogsend/core` and
   re-exported from `@hogsend/engine` (the canonical import). You supply an
   implementation via `createHogsendClient({ email: { provider }, analytics })`
   and the engine routes to it — including inbound provider webhooks.
   `@hogsend/plugin-resend` and `@hogsend/plugin-posthog` are the **bundled
   defaults and reference implementations**; you only swap when you want a
   different vendor. → `references/swap-a-provider.md`.
   Note: the `analytics` (`PostHogService`) role is now NARROW — it is NOT the
   outbound-event firing path (that's destinations, below). It's load-bearing for
   exactly two things: the identity **PULL** (`getPersonProperties` for per-user
   timezone resolution at enrollment) and the opt-in `bucket.syncToPostHog`
   person-property mirror. PostHog is otherwise just a destination (`kind="posthog"`).

2. **Integrations** (a one-directional call *out* to a service — post to Slack,
   create a CRM record, charge Stripe — from inside a JOURNEY at a specific
   step). **No contract, no framework.** Install the SDK, write a thin wrapper in
   your own `src/lib/`, import it into a journey, and call it like a function. The
   engine never sees it. → `references/build-an-integration.md`.

3. **Destinations** (fan the engine's OUTBOUND EVENT stream — `contact.*`,
   `email.*`, `journey.completed`, `bucket.*` — out to a tool DURABLY, on every
   matching event, not at a single journey step). A code-defined
   `defineDestination()` is a delivery-time transform keyed by an endpoint
   `kind`; it reuses the engine's durable retry / backoff / DLQ delivery. The
   engine ships `webhook`/`posthog`/`segment`/`slack` presets. → the
   **hogsend-authoring-destinations** skill.

**The deciding questions.** Does the engine DRIVE the capability (sending mail,
capturing analytics)? → a provider behind a contract (1). Are you reaching out at
ONE journey step? → a plain integration (2). Do you want EVERY lifecycle event
mirrored to a tool, durably? → a destination (3).

## Swapping a capability provider — the short version

- **Implement the contract.** `import type { EmailProvider } from "@hogsend/engine"`
  — four methods: `send`, `sendBatch`, `verifyWebhook`, `parseWebhook`. The
  reference implementation to copy is `packages/plugin-resend/src/provider.ts`
  (`createResendProvider`).
- **Wire it.** `createHogsendClient({ email: { templates, provider: createMyProvider(...) } })`.
  Analytics is a **top-level** option (the engine uses it for the identity pull +
  bucket sync, not for outbound fan-out):
  `createHogsendClient({ analytics: createMyAnalytics(...) })`.
- **You get everything else for free.** Template rendering, link-click + open
  tracking, preference/suppression checks, the frequency cap, and the
  `email_sends` row all live in the engine's `createTrackedMailer` — never in the
  provider. They come along regardless of which provider you supply.
- **Defaults.** Pass nothing and you get Resend (built from `RESEND_API_KEY`) +
  PostHog (from `POSTHOG_API_KEY`). Inbound delivery webhooks land at the
  engine-owned route `POST /v1/webhooks/email/:providerId` (`:providerId` =
  `meta.id`, so `…/email/resend` for the default; `POST /v1/webhooks/resend` is a
  deprecated alias). The provider's `verifyWebhook` normalizes the payload into an
  `EmailEvent` the engine maps to `email_sends` status + suppression.
- ⚠️ The contract's `SendEmailOptions` imports from `@hogsend/core` (or
  `@hogsend/plugin-resend`), **not** `@hogsend/engine` — the engine's own
  `SendEmailOptions` is a different, higher-level send type.

## Wiring an integration — the short version

- Install the SDK; write `src/lib/<service>.ts` exporting a
  `create<Service>(config)` factory that **validates config at construction, not
  at import** (so tests don't blow up on a missing env var).
- Import it into a journey and call it: `await slack.sendMessage({ ... })`. It's a
  function call, **not** `ctx.sendMessage` — `ctx` is orchestration-only.
- Heavy or background work (a nightly CRM sync, a fan-out import) → author a
  Hatchet task in `src/workflows/` and register it via
  `createWorker({ extraWorkflows })`.

## Fanning the event stream to a tool — the short version

When you want a tool to receive EVERY matching lifecycle event (an analytics
warehouse mirroring `email.*`, a Slack channel pinged on `email.bounced`), don't
hand-roll an integration call in every journey — author an outbound
**destination** instead. `defineDestination({ meta:{id}, events, transform })` in
`src/destinations/` is a delivery-time projection keyed by an endpoint `kind`,
and it inherits the engine's durable retry / backoff / DLQ delivery for free. The
engine ships `webhook` (default signed POST), `posthog`, `segment`, and `slack`
presets, so most fan-out is config (a `webhook_endpoints` row), not code. Wire
your `destinations` array into `createHogsendClient` in BOTH `src/index.ts` and
`src/worker.ts`. → the **hogsend-authoring-destinations** skill.

## When to publish a `@hogsend/plugin-*` package

Almost never from a scaffolded app. A standalone module in your `src/` is the
right default. Author and publish a real `@hogsend/plugin-*` package only when an
integration is **reusable across multiple apps** or you intend to **contribute it
back to the engine** — that is engine-development work done in a clone of the
Hogsend monorepo, not in your client app.

## What NOT to do

- **Don't put a service on `ctx`.** `ctx` is durable-orchestration primitives only
  (`sleep`, `sleepUntil`, `when`, `waitForEvent`, `checkpoint`, `trigger`, `guard`,
  `history`). There is no `ctx.posthog` / `ctx.identify` — those were removed; fan
  data out with a destination instead.
- **Don't reach for a provider contract for a one-directional call** — that's an
  integration (just code).
- **Don't import the `EmailProvider`/`PostHogService` contract from a
  `@hogsend/plugin-*` package** in new code — use `@hogsend/engine` (canonical).
  The plugins still re-export the contracts for back-compat, but new code should
  import from the engine.
