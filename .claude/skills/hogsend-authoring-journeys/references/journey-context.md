# JourneyContext (`ctx`) — the full primitive API

`ctx` is the SECOND argument to `run(user, ctx)`. It exposes **durable
orchestration primitives only** — the things that need Hatchet's durable
execution or the journey's bound state (sleep, checkpoints, triggering events,
reading history). It is deliberately small.

It is the `JourneyContext` type from `@hogsend/core`. Everything below is a real
method.

## Durable timing

```ts
// Durable Hatchet sleep. Sets state → "waiting" for the duration, then "active".
// The worker can restart mid-sleep and resume — this is the core durability win.
const { sleptAt, resumedAt } = await ctx.sleep({
  duration: days(2),          // DurationObject from days()/hours()/minutes()
  label: "post-welcome",      // optional — also written as currentNodeId
});

// Durable sleep until an absolute instant (Date or ISO string).
await ctx.sleepUntil(someDate, { label: "wait-for-renewal" });

// Timezone-bound fluent scheduler — always resolves to an absolute Date you
// then pass to sleepUntil. Bound to the user's resolved timezone.
const at = ctx.when.tomorrow().at("09:00");        // 9am local, tomorrow
await ctx.sleepUntil(at, { label: "morning-nudge" });
// other ctx.when builders: .next("mon").at("HH:mm"), .nextLocal("HH:mm"),
// .in(days(3)).at("HH:mm"), and chainers .tz(zone) / .window(start,end) / .ifPast("next"|"now")
```

## Durable wait-for-event

```ts
// Park the journey until THIS user emits `event`, OR `timeout` elapses —
// whichever first. The reactive alternative to "sleep a fixed window, then poll
// ctx.history": it resumes the INSTANT the event lands. Forward-looking — only
// events fired AFTER the wait begins count (use ctx.history.hasEvent for the past).
const { timedOut, properties } = await ctx.waitForEvent({
  event: Events.FEATURE_USED,
  timeout: days(7),           // REQUIRED, capped at the 720h task execution limit
  label: "await-activation",  // optional — written as currentNodeId
});
if (timedOut) {
  // they never did it — nudge (re-check ctx.guard.isSubscribed() first after a long wait)
} else {
  // event arrived — they activated on their own. `properties` carries the
  // matched event's payload (best-effort, scalars only) — branch on the
  // answer directly, e.g. a semantic-link NPS score:
  // if (typeof properties?.score === "number" && properties.score <= 6) { … }
}
```

NEVER put the awaited event in `exitOn` too: an `exitOn` match mid-wait aborts
the run (`JourneyExitedError`) BEFORE your post-wait branch executes. React via
`waitForEvent` OR exit via `exitOn` — one event name, one role.

Waiting twice for the same event (e.g. after a reminder send)? Pass
`lookback: hours(1)` on the second wait — the wait is forward-looking, so an
answer landing in the gap between the two waits would otherwise be missed;
`lookback` checks recent `user_events` first and resolves immediately with the
payload.

If the journey `exitOn`-matches (or is cancelled) WHILE waiting, the run aborts
cleanly — state goes `"exited"`, the durable run is cancelled, and no post-wait
step (or email) fires. You don't catch anything; the engine handles it.

## Observability

```ts
// Update currentNodeId on the journeyStates row — a breadcrumb for dashboards.
await ctx.checkpoint("awaiting-activation");
```

## Firing events (cross-journey orchestration)

```ts
// Push an event through the FULL ingest pipeline (stores it, routes to matching
// journey tasks via Hatchet, processes exitOn). Lets one journey trigger another.
await ctx.trigger({
  event: Events.JOURNEY_PRO_PATH,
  userId: user.id,            // defaults userEmail to the current user's email
  userEmail: user.email,      // optional override
  properties: { step: "pro_branch" },
});
```

## Fanning data out — use DESTINATIONS, not `ctx`

There is **no `ctx.identify` and no `ctx.posthog.capture`** — those single-vendor
PostHog shims were removed. `ctx` does not fan data out to product/data tools.

To mirror user/event data into PostHog, Segment, Slack, a CRM or a warehouse, set
up an outbound **DESTINATION**: the email/contact/journey/bucket lifecycle is
delivered there DURABLY (retry / backoff / DLQ), keyed by `webhook_endpoints.kind`.
You don't fire it from `run` — it receives the lifecycle automatically:

- `email.sent` / `email.delivered` / `email.opened` / `email.clicked` /
  `email.bounced` / `email.complained`, `contact.*`, `journey.completed`,
  `bucket.entered` / `bucket.left`.
- `email.delivered` is the canonical **"email was received"** signal.
- EVERY destination receives EVERY open and click — **per-hit, not first-touch** —
  so downstream tools see the full engagement stream.

See the **hogsend-authoring-destinations** skill. (PostHog is now JUST a
destination, `kind="posthog"`.) If you need a fire-and-forget raw write inside a
journey, `getPostHog()` is still importable from `@hogsend/engine` — but for
fan-out, reach for a destination, not an in-journey vendor call.

## Guards

```ts
// Re-check subscription AFTER a long sleep, before sending again.
if (await ctx.guard.isSubscribed()) {
  await sendEmail({ /* ... */ });
}
```

## History reads (branch on what already happened)

```ts
// Did this user fire an event (optionally within a window)?
const { found, count } = await ctx.history.hasEvent({
  userId: user.id,
  event: Events.FEATURE_USED,
  within: days(7),            // optional DurationObject
});

// Has this user completed another journey before? How many times entered?
const { completed, lastCompletedAt, entryCount } = await ctx.history.journey({
  userId: user.id,
  journeyId: "onboarding",
});

// Has this email already received a given template?
const { sent, lastSentAt, count } = await ctx.history.email({
  email: user.email,
  template: Templates.ACTIVATION_WELCOME,
});
```

## What is NOT on `ctx`

These are **standalone imports**, not methods — keeping `ctx` to pure
orchestration:

- **`sendEmail()`** — `import { sendEmail } from "@hogsend/engine"`. See
  `references/sending-email-from-a-journey.md`.
- **`getPostHog()`** — `import { getPostHog } from "@hogsend/engine"` for the raw
  PostHog service (a fire-and-forget escape hatch). For fanning lifecycle data out
  to product/data tools, prefer an outbound DESTINATION (see above) — it delivers
  durably and is vendor-neutral. Note: capture and `$set` person WRITES use the
  `phc_` project key; person READS (`getPersonProperties`) additionally need
  `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` (the project key is write-only by PostHog's design)
  and soft-fail to `{}` without it.
- **SMS / push / Slack** — plain functions you import, never on `ctx`.
- There is **no `ctx.db`, no `ctx.sendEmail`, no `ctx.hatchet`** surfaced to
  consumer journeys. If you reach for one of those, you are modelling it wrong —
  use a primitive above or a standalone import.

The `user` argument (first param) carries identity + attribution: `user.id`,
`user.email`, `user.properties`, `user.stateId` (pass to `sendEmail`),
`user.journeyId`, `user.journeyName`.
